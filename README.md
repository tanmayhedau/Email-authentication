# Email-authentication

MERN stack Task :

Create the email-based authentication system in which the following things should be done:
1. A registration form in which the user can register.
2. After registration, the user will be emailed a verification link on his/her email.
3. When that link is visited, the user will be verified. After that, the user will be redirected to the login form.
4. A login form in which a user enters a username and password. After successful login users will be redirected to the home page.
5. A Home page should be there to display logged-in user information.
6. User sessions should be maintained. If the user is not logged in and if he/she tries to access the home page from the URL then it should not be accessible and the user should be redirected to the login page. Same for the login page, if the user is already logged in and if he/she tries to access the login page then it should be redirected to the home page.
All the points are mandatory to be done.
